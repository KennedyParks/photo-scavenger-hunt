# Project 4 - *Photo Scavenger Hunt*

Submitted by: **Kennedy Parks**

**Photo Scavenger Hunt** is an app that allows users to solve a scavenger hunt game by using the images in their phone! The tools used were MapKit and PHPicker.

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] App displays list of hard-coded tasks
- [x] When a task is tapped it navigates the user to a task detail view
- [x] When user adds photo to complete the tasks, it marks the task as complete
- [x] When adding photo of task, the location is added
- [x] User returns to home page (list of tasks) and the status of your task is updated to complete
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can launch camera to snap a picture	

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- It would be cool to add a social aspect to this app. For example, the user could try to solve a scavenger hunt with prompts for a friend and try to guess the answers.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- In the beginning I struggled with getting the metadata from the images, but I figured that out relatively quickly.
